# CoverageJSON

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This repository is for development of the CoverageJSON specification for encoding [Coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coverage_data) data in [JSON](http://json.org/) format. This format is based on the main concepts of [ISO 19123](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=40121) and [GMLCOV](https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=48553), borrowing other concepts from [NetCDF](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) and the [Climate and Forecast conventions](http://cfconventions.org/), but is adapted for JSON idioms and usability. It is primarily (but not exclusively) intended for exchanging data between web browsers and servers.

This repository is work in progress, but contains:
 * The specification document, written in Markdown format
 * Sample data files
 * JSON schema documents for validating data files
 * A validator program (in Python) for further validation

Licences for the above are given in the appropriate folders and source files. This work is led by the University of Reading in the context of the [MELODIES](http://www.melodiesproject.eu) project.

This has been forked from https://github.com/neothemachine/coveragejson and is intended to be merged in the near future.
